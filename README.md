# Math-Deep-Dives
Analysis in mathematics is a vast and intricate field that deals with the rigorous study of limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, sequences, series, and more. It builds the foundation for understanding calculus, real and complex functions, measure theory, and functional analysis. Some key concepts include:

* **Limits and Continuity:** Exploring how functions behave as inputs approach certain values.

* **Differentiation:** Understanding rates of change and slopes of curves.

* **Integration:** Accumulating quantities and finding areas under curves.

* **Sequences and Series:** Investigating infinite sums and convergence properties.

* **Measure Theory:** Formalizing the notions of length, area, and probability.

* **Functional Analysis:** Studying infinite-dimensional spaces and operators.

# Table of Context

* **[Dot Product](./dot_product.ipynb)** – or scalar product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors), and returns a single number.

* **[Natural Exponential](./natural_exponential.ipynb)** – The natural exponential function, written as `e^x` or `exp(x)`, is a special type of exponential function that uses the constant `e ≈ 2.71828` as its base. It’s called "natural" because it arises organically across a wide variety of mathematical and scientific contexts—especially when modeling continuous growth or decay processes. This function plays a foundational role in calculus, differential equations, and probability theory.
