Analysis in mathematics is a vast and intricate field that deals with the rigorous study of limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, sequences, series, and more. It builds the foundation for understanding calculus, real and complex functions, measure theory, and functional analysis. Some key concepts include:

* **Limits and Continuity:** Exploring how functions behave as inputs approach certain values.

* **Differentiation:** Understanding rates of change and slopes of curves.

* **Integration:** Accumulating quantities and finding areas under curves.

* **Sequences and Series:** Investigating infinite sums and convergence properties.

* **Measure Theory:** Formalizing the notions of length, area, and probability.

* **Functional Analysis:** Studying infinite-dimensional spaces and operators.
